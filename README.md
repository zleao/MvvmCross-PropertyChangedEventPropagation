#PropertyChanged Event Propagation
=================================

This is my approach for enabling property changed event propagation across the ViewModels in an Mvvm approach.
The goal is to be able to use attributes decoration to map dependencies between properties and/or methods within the ViewModel

This is a follow up of a request made in the MvvmCross repo: https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross/issues/300
