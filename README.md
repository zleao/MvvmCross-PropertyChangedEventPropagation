PropertyChangedEventPropagation
===============================

This is my approach for enabling proerty changed evnt propagation across the ViewModels in an Mvvm approach.
The goal is to be able to use attributes to decorate properties and/or methods of a ViewModel, that will map dependencies between properties in that same ViewModel
this is a follow up of a request made in the MvvmCross repo: https://github.com/slodge/MvvmCross/issues/300
